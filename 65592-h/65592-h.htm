<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a perilous adventure&mdash;the writing of a preface, however brief, to
one’s own poems. For one may be tempted to re-state matters that could
find their full elucidation only in the verses themselves. Tennyson once
remarked that poetry is like shot silk, glancing with many colours; and
any attempt to define its meanings is as great a mistake as the attempt
of nineteenth-century materialism to enclose the infinite universe in
its logical nut-shells. Through poetry alone, whether of deeds or words,
thought or colour, passion or marble, is it possible to approach the
Infinite, or as Blake did:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘To see a world in a grain of sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A heaven in a wild flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And Eternity in an hour.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But this revelation is the sole end and object of all true art; and I
hope it may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> thought presumptuous to say here simply
that&mdash;whether the attempt be a success or a failure&mdash;it was especially
my own aim in the two following poems. If the feet of childhood are set
dancing in them, it was because as children we are best able to enter
into that Kingdom of Dreams which is also the only true, the only real,
Kingdom. The first tale, for instance, must not be taken to have any
real relation to Japan. It belongs&mdash;as the <i>Spectator</i> put it&mdash;to the
kind of dreamland which an imaginative child might construct out of the
oddities of a willow-pattern plate, and it differs chiefly from
Wonderlands of the Lewis Carrol type in a certain seriousness behind its
fantasy. It is astonishing to me that these things require comment; but
undoubtedly they do. For, on the one hand, the first tale has been
praised enthusiastically as a vivid picture of Japan, and the author has
not only had to correspond with Tokyo on the subject, but was also
invited to meetings of the Japan Society in London! On the other hand,
because the child-voices are allowed to declare that Tusitala lies
asleep in that distant country of dreams, a prosaic English critic once
wrote a lengthy review in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> an important paper to point out my gross
ignorance of the fact that Stevenson was really buried in Samoa! The
tales are ‘such stuff as dreams are made on’; but&mdash;as a kinder critic
has remarked&mdash;‘we ourselves are made of that stuff.’ It is perhaps
because these poems are almost light enough for a nonsense-book that I
feel there is something in them more elemental, more essential, more
worthy of serious consideration, than the most ponderous philosophical
poem I could write. They are based on the fundamental and very simple
mystery of the universe&mdash;that anything, even a grain of sand, should
exist at all. If we could understand that, we could understand
everything! Set clear of all irrelevancies, that is the simple problem
that has been puzzling all the ages; and it is well sometimes to forget
our accumulated ‘knowledge’ and return to it in all its childish
<i>naïveté</i>. It is well to face that inconceivable miracle, that
fundamental impossibility which happens to have been possible, that
contradiction in terms, that fundamental paradox, for which we have at
best only a cruciform symbol, with its arms pointing in opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span>
directions and postulating, at once, an infinite God.</p>

<p>The inscription on the “Wisdom Looking-Glass”; the discovery by the
children that the self-limitation of their little wishes was necessary
not only to their own happiness, but to the harmony of the whole world;
the development of the same idea in the passages leading up to the
song&mdash;<i>What does it take to make a rose?</i>&mdash;where a <i>divine</i> act of
loving self-limitation, an eternal self-sacrifice, an everlasting
passion of the Godhead, such as perhaps was shadowed forth on Calvary,
is found to be at the heart of the Universe, and to be&mdash;as it were&mdash;the
highest aspect of the Paradox aforesaid, the living secret and price of
our very existence; these things are only one twisted strand of the
‘shot silk’ out of which the two tales are woven. It is no new wisdom to
regard these things through the eyes of little children; and I
know&mdash;however insignificant they may be to others&mdash;these two tales
contain as deep and true things as I, personally, have the power to
express. I hope, therefore, that I may be pardoned, in these hurried
days, for pointing out that the two poems are not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> taken merely as
fairy-tales, but as an attempt to follow the careless and happy feet of
childhood back into the kingdom of those dreams which, as we said above,
are the sole reality worth living and dying for; those beautiful dreams,
or those fantastic jests&mdash;if any care to call them so&mdash;for which mankind
has endured so many triumphant martyrdoms that even amidst the rush and
roar of modern materialism they cannot be quite forgotten.</p>

<span class="i0">So with cosy toes and hands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We were dreaming, just like you;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Smoothly as a shell-shaped fan,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When we turned to Old Japan!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Till a panel seemed to fall<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Stepped into the glimmering room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he held a little fan,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">If you pitied a thing, you pretended to sneer;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">About the fragrant fall of day<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A blue-domed tea-house, bossed with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hungry and thirsty we entered in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should we know what Creeping Sin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had breathed in that Emperor’s ear who sold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own dumb soul for an evil jewel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the earth-gods, blind and ugly and cruel?...<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We drank sweet tea as his tale was told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a garden of blue chrysanthemums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While a drowsy swarming of gongs and drums<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the sunset dreamily rolled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, as the murmur nearer drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fat black bonze, in a robe of blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Suddenly at the gate appeared;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close behind, with that evil grin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Was it Creeping Sin, was it Creeping Sin?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bonze looked quietly down and sneered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our guide! Was he sleeping? We could not wake him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However we tried to pinch and shake him!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Blind from a terrible furnace door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blares, or the mouth of a dragon, blazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seething gateway: deaf and dazed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the clanging and the wild uproar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stood; while a thousand oval eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gapped our fear with a sick surmise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, as the dead sea parted asunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clamour clove with a sound of thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In two great billows; and all was quiet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaunt and black was the palankeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">But wizen and white was the tall thin man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As he rose in his sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes were closed, his lips were wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crouched like a leopard that dares not leap.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bearers halted: the tall thin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearfully dreaming, waved his fan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With wizard fingers, to and fro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, with a whimper of evil glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nameless Emperor’s mad Moonshee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stepped in front of us: dark and slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the words of the doom that he dared not name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, over the ground, as he spoke, there came<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tiny circles of soft blue flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like ghosts of flowers they began to glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flow like a moonlit brook between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our feet and the terrible palankeen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Moonshee wrinkled his long thin eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sneered, “Have you stolen the strength of the skies?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then pour before us a stream of pearl!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us the pearl and the gold we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our hearts will be softened and let you go;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But these are toys for a foolish girl&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These vanishing blossoms&mdash;what are they worth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are not so heavy as dust and earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pour before us a stream of pearl!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, with a wild strange laugh, our guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched his arms to the West and cried<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once, and a song came over the sea;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the blossoms of moon-soft fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woke and breathed as a wind-swept lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the garden surged into harmony;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it seemed that the soul of the whole world sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every petal became a tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To tell the thoughts of Eternity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Moonshee lifted his painted brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stared at the gold on the blue tea-house:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Can you clothe your body with dreams?” he sneered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“If you taught us the truths that we always know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our heart might be softened and let you go:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can you tell us the length of a monkey’s beard,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And again, with a wild strange laugh, our guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked at him; and he shrunk aside,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Shaking their petals out, sheaf by sheaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with disks like shields and stems like towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned the host of the passion-flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... Had the Moonshee flown like a midnight thief?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... Yet a thing like a monkey, shrivelled and black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chattered and danced as they forced him back.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As the coward chatters for empty pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the face of a foe that he cannot but fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And its voice rang strangely upon the ear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the cry of a wizard that dares not own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another’s brighter and mightier throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the wrath of a fool that rails aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the fire that burnt him; the brazen bray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clamoured and sang o’er the gaping crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And flapped like a gabbling goose away.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So the cry flapped off as a wild goose flies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As guards of a path to the heart’s desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strange tall blossoms of soft blue fire<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stretched away thro’ that unknown land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">League on league with their dwindling lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the large low moon; and again<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now along the passage walls<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those cloudy floors of sea-soft jade.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, in the midst, an idol rose<br /></span>

<span class="i2">On lonely Himalayan heights:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over its head the spikenard spilled<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Whispered with slow, strange lips</i>&mdash;we knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not what, but Creeping Sin went blue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With fear; again his eyes began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slant aside; then through the porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed, and lit a tall, brown torch.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down a corridor dark as death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beating hearts and bated breath<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We hurried; far away we heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dreadful hissing, fierce as fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rain begins to quench a pyre;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And where the smoky torch-light flared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange vermin beat their bat-like wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wet walls dropped with slimy things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And darker, darker, wound the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond all gleams of night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And still that hideous hissing grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder and louder on our ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tortured us with eyeless fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then suddenly the gloom turned blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the wall, a rough rock cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaped, like a phosphorescent grave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And from the purple mist within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a wild tumultuous din<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of snakes that reared their heads and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">hissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a witch’s cauldron boiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All round the door great serpents coiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With eyes of glowing amethyst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fierce blue flames began to slide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like shooting stars from side to side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! with a sickly gasping grin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quivering eyelids, Creeping Sin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stole to the cave; but, suddenly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through its glimmering mouth he passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpents flashed and gripped him fast:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He wriggled and gave one awful cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all at once the cave was cleared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snakes with their victim had disappeared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And fearlessly the tall thin man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened his turquoise-tinted fan<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And entered; and the mists grew bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we saw that the cave was a diamond hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit with lamps for a festival.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A myriad globes of coloured light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went gliding deep in its massy sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the shimmering moons in the glassy tides<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where a sea-king’s palace enchants the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gliding and flowing, a glory and wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through each other, and over, and under,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lucent orbs of green and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright with sorrow or soft with sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In music through the glimmering deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over their secret axles rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And circled by the murmuring spheres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw in a frame of frozen tears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mirror that made the blood run cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, when we came to it, we found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It imaged everything around<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Except the face that gazed in it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the mirrored face should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heart-shaped Ruby fierily<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smouldered; and round the frame was writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mystery: Time and Tide shall pass,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I am the Wisdom Looking-Glass.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This is the Ruby none can touch:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Many have loved it overmuch;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Its fathomless fires flutter and sigh,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Being as images of the flame</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That shall make earth and heaven the same</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>When the fire of the end reddens the sky,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i2">Tears were glistening in his eyes:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His head upon his breast and went<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O, madly we clutched at the mirrored stone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wished we were back on the flowery plain:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The whole world flashed, and behold we were there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes; there was the port of Old Japan,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Spread by the blue sea, faint and far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far away we heard once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sound of singing on the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where boys in blue kimonos bore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roses in a golden jar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we heard, where the cherry orchards blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpent-charmers fluting low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the song of the maidens of Miyako.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And at our feet unbroken lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glass that had whirled us thither away:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We sat and wished all sorts of things:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, we were wealthier than kings!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We ruled the world for several hours!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, it seemed, we knew not why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the daisies began to die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We wished them alive again; but soon<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Like peacocks through the sunlit air:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the butterflies flapped into silver fish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each wish spoiled another wish;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till we threw the glass down in despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, getting whatever you want to get,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is like drinking tea from a fishing net.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last we thought we’d wish once more<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And then we’d shatter the glass, if we could;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But just as the world grew right again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard a wanderer out on the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Singing what none of us understood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet we thought that the world grew thrice more sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the meadows were blossoming under his feet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And we felt a grand and beautiful fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we knew that a marvellous thought drew near;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So we kept the glass for a little while:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the skies grew deeper and twice as bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the seas grew soft as a flower of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the meadows rippled from stile to stile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And memories danced in a musical throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro’ the blossom that scented the wonderful song.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But wheresoe’er we sailed we took our little lubber Peterkin,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And so we liked our Peterkin, our trusty little Peterkin.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Peterkin, Peterkin, I think if you came back<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The captain of our host to-day should be the bugler Peterkin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A band of noble brigands, bearing each a mighty pack<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Crammed with lace and jewels to the secret cave of Peterkin,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The Spanish cloak, the velvet mask, we’d give them all to Peterkin.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Come and look for Peterkin, little brother Peterkin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our merry little comrade that the fairies took away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For people think we’ve lost him, and when we come to say<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our good-night prayers to mother, if we pray for little Peterkin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes are very sorrowful, she turns her head away.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I wonder if they’ve taken him again across the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the town of Wonder-Wander and the Amfalula tree<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the land of many marvels where we roamed of old with Peterkin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Now</span> father stood engaged in talk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mother on that narrow walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the laurels (where we play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Red-skins lurking for their prey)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grey old wall of roses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the Persian kitten dozes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sunlight sleeps upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crannies of the crumbling stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;So hot it is you scarce can bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your naked hand upon it there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, since we greatly wished to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether we too might some day go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where little Peterkin had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without one word and all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We crept up through the laurels there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping that we might overhear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid secret, darkly great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Peterkin’s mysterious fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on what high adventure bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left our pleasant garden-ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether for old Japan once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He voyaged from the dim blue shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether he set out to run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By candle-light to Babylon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We just missed something father said<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And failed: how hopes were brought to nought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and mortals made to bow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before the Juggernaut of Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world was darker now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Time’s grey lips and icy breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had blown out all the enchanted lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burned in Love’s Arabian nights;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now he could not understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother’s mystic fairy-land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Land of the dead, poor fairy-tale,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He murmured, and her face grew pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then with great soft shining eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She leant to him&mdash;she looked so wise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with her cheek against his cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard her, ah so softly, speak.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Husband, there was a happy day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ago, in love’s young May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with a wild-flower in your hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You echoed that dead poet’s cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>Little flower, but if I could understand!</i>’<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And you saw it had roots in the depths of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there in that smallest bud lay furled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret and meaning of all the world.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He shook his head and then he tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kiss her, but she only cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned her face away and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You come between me and my dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul is near me, night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you would drive it far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you shall never kiss me now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until you lift that brave old brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of faith I know so well; or else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refute the tale the skylark tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tarnish the glory of that May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explain the Smallest Flower away.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he said, “Poor fairy-tales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How terribly their starlight pales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the solemn sun of truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rises o’er the grave of youth!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Is heaven a fairy-tale?” she said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once again he shook his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet we ne’er could understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why heaven should <i>not</i> be fairy-land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A part of heaven at least, and why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought of it made mother cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why they went away so sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And father still quite unforgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what could children be but glad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To find a fairy-land in heaven?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as we talked it o’er we found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our brains were really spinning round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dick, our eldest, late returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From school, by all the lore he’d learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declared that we should seek the lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smallest Flower at any cost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since within its leaves lay furled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret of the whole wide world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought that we might learn therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whereabouts of Peterkin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if we found the Flower, we knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father would be forgiven, too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mother’s kiss atone for all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quarrel by the rose-hung wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We knew not how, we knew not why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dick it was who bade us try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dick made it all seem plain and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dick it is who helps us here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell this tale of fairy-land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In words we scarce can understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ere another golden hour<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had passed, our anxious parents found<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We’d left the scented garden-ground<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Under the cloudy lilac-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out at the garden-gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stole, a little band of three,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There was no human eye to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">To ladybirds that creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like little crimson shimmering gems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the tiny twisted stems<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of fairy forests deep;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through jungles of the golden grass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you could suddenly become<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh then, as through the mighty shades<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild thyme woods and violet glades<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You groped your forest-way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fraught each fragrant bough would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dark o’erhanging mystery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How high the forest aisles would loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What wondrous wings would beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through gloamings loaded with perfume<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In many a rich retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While trees like purple censers bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swung beneath a swooning cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mysteriously sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where flowers that haunt no mortal clime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burden the Forest of Wild Thyme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We’d watched the bats and beetles flit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through sunset-coloured air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night that we discovered it<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the heavens were bare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’d seen the colours melt and pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like silent ghosts across the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sleep&mdash;our hearts knew where;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so we rose, and hand in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sought the gates of fairy-land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Peterkin, oh Peterkin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cry was in our ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fairy clamour, clear and thin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From lands beyond the years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wistful note, a dying fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of the fairy bugle-call<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some dreamful changeling hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pines within his mortal home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more through fairy-land to roam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We left behind the pleasant row<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of cottage window-panes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village inn’s red-curtained glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lovers in the lanes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stout of heart and strong of will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We climbed the purple perfumed hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hummed the sweet refrains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fairy tunes the tall thin man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught us of old in Old Japan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So by the tall wide-barred church-gate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through which we all could pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We came to where that curious plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That foolish plate of brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Peterkin was fast asleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a cold and ugly heap<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of earth and stones and grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a splendid place for play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That churchyard, on a summer’s day;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A splendid place for hide-and-seek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Between the grey old stones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where even grown-ups used to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In awestruck whispering tones;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there the grass ran wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In jungles for the creeping child,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there were elfin zones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twisted flowers and words in rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great sweet cushions of wild thyme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So in a wild thyme snuggery there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We stayed awhile to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bell was calling folk to prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One star was in the West:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cottage lights grew far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole sky seemed to waver and sway<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above our fragrant nest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from a distant dreamland moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more we heard that fairy tune:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why, mother once had sung it us<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When, ere we went to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She told the tale of Pyramus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">How Thisbe found him dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mourned his eyes as green as leeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cherry nose, his cowslip cheeks.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Sherwood now and faintly shaken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest-scents from off their feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet from some divine retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the music, sweet and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hang upon the raptured ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the free unfettered sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blossoms in the moon of May.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! the luscious fluttering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flower-soft words that kiss and cling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And part again with sweet farewells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rhyme and chime like fairy-bells.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out of the undiscovered land<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The fragrant aisles along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where long ago had gone to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some enchanted distant dell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The outlawed fairy throng<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as we dreamed, the shadowy ground<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed gradually to swell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a strange forest rose around,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But how&mdash;we could not tell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purple against a rose-red sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The big boughs brooded silently:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came a cry, a fiercer flash,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like battleships they thundered by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then, as down that mighty dell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We followed, faint with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We understood the tolling bell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That called the monsters there;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That tunnelled through the woods and showed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so we thought, a good clear way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the upper lands of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great silken cables overhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many a mighty mesh were spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Netting the rounded arch, no doubt<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So thick and close the cords had grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No leaf could through their meshes stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the faint moonlight died away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only a strange grey glimmer shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guide our weary footsteps on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, tired out, we stood before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The end, a great grey silken door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then from out a weird old wicket, overgrown with shaggy hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a weird and wicked eyebrow round a weird and wicked eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Two great eyeballs and a beard<br /></span>
<span class="i8">For one ghastly moment peered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At our faces with a sudden stealthy stare:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then the door was opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And a hideous hermit cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a shy and soothing smile from out his lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Won’t you walk into my parlour? I can make you cosy there!</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And we couldn’t quite remember where we’d heard that phrase before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the great grey-bearded ogre stood beside his open door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an echo seemed to answer from a land beyond the sky&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Won’t you walk into my parlour? said the spider to the fly!</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then we looked a little closer at the ogre as he stood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And his mighty speckled belly and his dreadful clutching claws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his nose&mdash;a horny parrot’s beak, his whiskers and his jaws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he seemed so sympathetic, and we saw two tears descend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he murmured, “I’m so ugly, but I’ve lost my dearest friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell you most lymphatic’ly, I’ve yearnings in my soul,”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right along his parrot’s beak we saw the tear-drops roll;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s an <i>arrant sentimentalist</i>, we heard a distant sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Won’t you weep upon my bosom? said the spider to the fly.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If you’d dreamed my dreams of beauty, if you’d seen my works of art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you’d felt the cruel hunger that is gnawing at my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grief that never leaves me and the love I can’t forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For I loved with all the letters in the Chinese alphabet!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, you’d all come in to comfort me: you ought to help the weak;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In a silence deep as death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There were scarlet gleams and crimson<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the curious foggy grey,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Old canals at fall of day,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Those dark curtains, splashed with red,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Oh, we want to hear of Peterkin; good sir, you say you know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won’t you tell us, won’t you put us in the way we want to go?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we pleaded, for he seemed so very full of sighs and tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we couldn’t doubt his kindness, and we smothered all our fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he said, “You must be crazy if you come to me for help;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should I desire to send you to your horrid little whelp?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again the foolish echo made a far-away reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Oh, don’t come to me for comfort,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The prison where our hearts lay bound;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There swelled a distant marching hymn<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till, with great bulging eyes of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought the wicket again to peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the tunnel, as like sweet rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard the still approaching strain,<br /></span>

PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED</h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Shyly we surveyed our guides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through the gloomy woods we went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the light that the straggling moonbeams lent:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We envied them their easy strides!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pease-blossom in his crimson cap<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And delicate suit of rose-leaf green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crimson sash and his jewelled dagger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strutted along with an elegant swagger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which showed that he didn’t care one rap<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For anything less than a Fairy Queen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes were deep like the eyes of a poet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Although his crisp and curly hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certainly didn’t seem to show it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">While Mustard-seed was a devil-may-care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Epigrammatic and pungent fellow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in a splendid suit of yellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With emerald stars on his glittering breast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eyes that shone with a diamond light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made you feel sure it would always be best<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To tell him the truth: he was not perhaps <i>quite</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So polite as Pease-blossom, but then who could be<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quite</i> such a debonair fairy as he?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We never could tell you one-half that we heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw on that journey. For instance, a bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten times as big as an elephant stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of a nest like a great thick wood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds in glimmering wreaths were spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind its vast and shadowy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rolled at us trembling below. (Its eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were like great black moons in those pearl-pale skies.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we feared he might take us, perhaps, for a worm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he ruffled his breast with the sound of a storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snuggled his head with a careless disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under his huge hunched wing again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mustard-seed said, as we stole thro’ the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was nothing to fear: it was only a Lark!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so he cheered the way along<br /></span>

<span class="i2">While dear Pease-blossom before him swam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a billow of lovely moonlit song,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Telling us why they had left their home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Sherwood, and had hither come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell in this magical scented clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dim old Forest of sweet Wild Thyme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Men toil,” he said, “from morn till night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bleeding hands and blinded sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For gold, more gold! They have betrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trust that in their souls was laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fairy birthright they have sold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For little disks of mortal gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now they cannot even see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold upon the greenwood tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wealth of coloured lights that pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In soft gradations through the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The riches of the love untold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wakes the day from grey to gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And howsoe’er the moonlight weaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magic webs among the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Englishmen care little now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For elves beneath the hawthorn bough:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor if Robin should return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare they of an outlaw learn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For them the Smallest Flower is furled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute is the music of the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unbelief has driven away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty from the blossomed spray.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Mustard-seed with diamond eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taught us to be laughter-wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he showed us how that Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is much less powerful than a rhyme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that Space is but a dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“For look,” he said, with eyes agleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Now you are become so small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You think the Thyme a forest tall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But underneath your feet you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A world of wilder mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, if you were smaller yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would just as soon forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This forest, which you’d leave above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you have left the home you love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since the Thyme you used to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems a forest here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What if you should sink again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find there stretched a mighty plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between each grass-blade and the next?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’d think till you were quite perplexed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Especially if all the flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lit the sweet Thyme-forest bowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were in that wild transcendent change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to Temples, great and strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a pillared portal high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And domes that swelled against the sky!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And creeping through the music once again the fairy cry<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Once more the fairy bugles blew from lands beyond the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we all groped out together, dazed and blind, we knew not why;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out through the City’s farther gates we went to look for Peterkin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out, out into the dark Unknown, and heard the clamour die<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far, far away behind us as we trotted on to Peterkin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then once more along the rare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forest-paths we groped our way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the glow-worm’s league-long glare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turned the Wild Thyme night to day:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Often through the glamorous gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Almost on the top of us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We beheld a beetle loom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a hippopotamus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once or twice a spotted toad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a mountain wobbled by<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once a caterpillar bowed<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Sleeping on a quiet hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once we came upon a moth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fast asleep with outspread wings,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There above the woods in state<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Delicately like a great<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though they were but flowers on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, we dared not enter in;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Less than awe were more than sin!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet their mystic anthems came<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sweetly to our listening ears;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">“No more sorrow, no more tears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither Peterkin has gone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You, assuredly, shall go:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">All he knows you, too, shall know!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So we thought we’d onward roam<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a less tremendous dome<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, perchance, if we should dare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Timidly to enter in,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Give us news of Peterkin.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At last we saw a crimson porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far away, like a dull red torch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning in the purple gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a great ocean of perfume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled round us as we drew anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then we strangely seemed to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadow of a mighty psalm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A sound as if a golden sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of music swung in utter calm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the shores of Eternity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then we saw the mighty dome<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of some mysterious Temple tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On high; and knew that we had come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At last, to that sweet House of Grace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which wise men find in every place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Temple of the Smallest Flower.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there&mdash;alas&mdash;our fairy friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered, “Here our kingdom ends:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Whither Peterkin is gone<br /></span>

<span class="i2">We, poor fairies, have no souls!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So “Good-bye, good-bye,” they said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Dear little seekers-for-the-dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They vanished; ah, but as they went<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Between the waves of that golden sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cradle-songs of Eternity;<br /></span>

<p>“Imagination, the capacity to perceive vividly and feel sincerely, and
the gift of fit and beautiful expression in verse-form&mdash;if these may be
taken as the equipment of a poet, nearly all of this volume is poetry.
And if to the sum of these be added the indescribable increment of charm
which comes occasionally to the work of some poet, quite unearned by any
of these catalogued qualities of his, you have a fair measure of Mr.
Noyes at his best.... Two considerations render Mr. Noyes interesting
above most poets: the wonderful degree in which the personal charm
illumines what he has already written, and the surprises which one feels
may be in store in his future work. His feelings have already so much
variety and so much apparent sincerity that it is impossible to tell in
what direction his genius will develop. In whatever style he
writes,&mdash;the mystical, the historical-dramatic, the impassioned
description of natural beauty, the ballad, the love lyric,&mdash;he has the
peculiarity of seeming in each style to have found the truest expression
of himself.”&mdash;<i>Louisville Courier-Journal.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
